## Projects Overview

### Air Pollution Prediction
This project aims to predict air pollution levels using historical data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and pollutant concentrations, various regression models are applied to forecast air quality. The project involves data cleaning, feature selection, and model evaluation to ensure accurate predictions, which can be crucial for public health and policy-making.

### Document Classification
In this project, text documents are classified into predefined categories using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. Techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and word embeddings are employed to extract meaningful features from the text, followed by the application of classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and neural networks to accurately categorize documents based on their content.

### E-Mail Spam Detection
This project focuses on identifying spam emails using machine learning classifiers. The dataset consists of emails labeled as spam or ham (not spam), and the project involves preprocessing the text, extracting relevant features, and training models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to detect spam. Effective spam detection helps in maintaining email security and user privacy.

### Sales Prediction Using Python
Aimed at forecasting future sales based on historical data, this project applies various regression techniques to predict sales figures. By analyzing past sales trends and incorporating features such as seasonality and promotional events, models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods are used to provide accurate sales forecasts, which are essential for inventory management and business planning.

### Stock Prediction LSTM Model
This project involves predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which are well-suited for time series prediction tasks. The model takes into account historical stock prices and other relevant financial indicators to predict future stock movements. The use of LSTM helps capture long-term dependencies and trends in the data, providing more reliable predictions for stock trading strategies.

### Titanic Classification
A classic machine learning project where the goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other socioeconomic factors. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to determine the likelihood of survival, providing insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

### Unemployment in India
This project analyzes and predicts unemployment rates in India using historical data and machine learning techniques. By examining economic indicators, demographic data, and other relevant factors, regression models are developed to forecast unemployment trends. This analysis can help policymakers and economists understand and address the underlying causes of unemployment in the country.

### Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews
This sentiment analysis project classifies product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. By preprocessing the text and extracting features such as sentiment scores and word frequencies, models like Naive Bayes, SVM, and deep learning classifiers are used to gauge customer sentiments. This analysis is valuable for businesses to understand customer feedback and improve their products and services.
