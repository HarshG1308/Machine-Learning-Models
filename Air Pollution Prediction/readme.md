# Air Quality Forecasting with Machine Learning using Various Methods

## Introduction:
Air pollution is a pressing global issue, causing millions of deaths worldwide. This project aims to forecast air quality using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as T5, traditional methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Facebook's Prophet, and ARIMA.

## Workflow for each Method:

### T5 (Transformer-based Language Model):
- **Data Preparation:** Load air quality data from the CPCB dataset, converting it into a suitable format for training.
- **Fine-tuning T5 Model:** Train the T5 model using PyTorch, optimizing for air quality forecasting. Fine-tuning involves adjusting parameters to improve performance.
- **Prediction:** Generate predictions for the next 24 hours using the fine-tuned T5 model. The model predicts PM2.5 levels based on historical data.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
- **Data Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess the air quality dataset. Scale the data using MinMaxScaler and create input sequences and target variables for LSTM.
- **Model Building:** Construct an LSTM model using Keras with TensorFlow backend. Define the architecture, compile the model, and fit it to the training data.
- **Prediction and Evaluation:** Make predictions for the test set, inverse transform the scaled predictions, and calculate Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for both train and test sets.
- **Insights:** Analyze LSTM's performance compared to other models, considering its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series data.

### Prophet (Facebook's Time Series Forecasting Model):
- **Data Preparation:** Load the dataset and preprocess it, ensuring the required format for Prophet.
- **Model Fitting:** Use Prophet to fit the model to historical air quality data. This step includes making future date predictions.
- **Visualization:** Plot the forecasted values along with upper and lower bounds for uncertainty estimation.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the accuracy of Prophet's forecasts, considering its robustness in handling seasonality and holiday effects.

### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Read the dataset and preprocess it, handling missing values and setting date columns.
- **Model Fitting:** Fit an ARIMA model to the preprocessed data, specifying the order parameter.
- **Forecasting:** Forecast the next seven days of pollution levels using the fitted ARIMA model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Print the summary of the ARIMA model, which includes statistical information and plot the actual vs. predicted values.
- **Comparison:** Compare ARIMA's performance with other methods, highlighting its suitability for capturing linear relationships in time series data.

## Conclusion:
Each method offers its advantages and limitations in forecasting air quality. T5 utilizes Transformer-based architecture, LSTM captures sequential dependencies, Prophet handles time series with seasonality, and ARIMA provides statistical forecasting. Evaluating the performance of each model is crucial in determining the most suitable approach for air quality forecasting tasks. Further analysis may involve ensemble techniques or hybrid models to improve forecast accuracy.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple models, such as T5, LSTM, Prophet, and ARIMA, through ensemble methods like stacking or averaging, may lead to improved forecast accuracy and robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance further. Techniques like grid search or random search can help identify the best hyperparameter configurations.
- **Real-time Deployment:** Consider the scalability and computational requirements of each model for real-time deployment. LLMs may require significant computational resources, whereas simpler models like ARIMA may be more suitable for real-time forecasting in resource-constrained environments.
- **Limitations of LLMs:** While LLMs excel in various natural language processing tasks, they may not be the best choice for time series forecasting due to several reasons:
  - Lack of Temporal Understanding: LLMs are primarily trained for text generation tasks and may not inherently capture the temporal dependencies present in time series data.
  - Complexity and Overfitting: LLMs have millions to billions of parameters, making them prone to overfitting on small datasets commonly encountered in time series forecasting tasks.
  - Computational Overhead: Training and inference with LLMs require significant computational resources, making them less practical for real-time forecasting applications compared to simpler models like ARIMA or Prophet.
  - Interpretability Challenges: Understanding the inner workings of LLMs and interpreting their predictions can be challenging, hindering trust and usability in forecasting applications.
